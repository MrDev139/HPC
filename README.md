# HPC
Hot Potato Challenge is a quick challenge available via the command inspired by hypixel minigames tnttag and the luckyblock item hotpotato

# Compability
The plugin has been tested on 1.8.8-1.17.1 servers and it's fully functionable (Spigot API)

# Commands
- /hotpotato start <amount> (unit is seconds, if amount is absent it will start it with 10 seconds)
- /hotpotato check (shows you if the challenge is started in the server and the selected player)

> **Note:** This is not a full minigame plugin it's just a challenge that starts by executing a command
